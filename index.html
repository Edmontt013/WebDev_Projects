        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Application to support diagnosis in patients with suspected COVID-19, pneumonia or bronchitis.</h4>
                <p>
                    Using Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Neural Networks, I was able to generate a simple graphical interface for the
                    loading and classification of images such as thoracic CT scans and X-rays for further enhancement, segmentation and classification,
                    Achieving up to 97% classification accuracy
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Design of a position and depth sensing prototype.</h4>
                <p>
                    Using Python, two digital cameras, and pattern recognition, manipulation, and feature extraction techniques
                    In digital imaging, I designed a prototype of a location and depth support system for an object in space.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Creation of an application for the management of a musical instrument store.</h4>
                <p>
                    Based on the Java language, together with other software such as MySQL, I designed an application for the sale and management of
                    musical instruments thanks to a graphical interface, implementing functionalities such as shopping cart,
                    Tables, Inventory Creation and Management.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Design of an application for ticket sales in a cinema.</h4>
                <p>
                    Using Java, I generated the implementation of a graphical interface, which included functionalities such as the sale of
                    tickets, updating of available places as well as the issuance of purchase receipts.
